# Carrington Allison's Personal Website

Welcome to my personal website! This site showcases my portfolio, interests, and background. I made this site ages ago so it is simply built using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. But that doesn't mean I didn't take my time to make it look beautiful! I come in and update the data from time to time to keep everything fresh. 

## About

This website serves as a digital resume and portfolio. It includes sections about my background, education, interests, and a showcase some of my projects.

## Portfolio

The portfolio section highlights some of my key projects, including:

- **Pill Coach**: A productivity pill reminder application.
- **SoulM8**: An intuitive dating app.
- **Top 5**: A website displaying the top 5 fantasy football players and sports bars.
- **Paradise**: A search engine powered by Giphy.com.
- **Teen Titans Go!**: A fun math-inspired game.
- **HangMan**: A classic hangman game.
